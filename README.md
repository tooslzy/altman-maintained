## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 (Tested for Windows 11 24H2)
- Active internet connection

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 (or Build Tools) with the **Desktop development with C++** workload
- CMake ≥ 3.25
- [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) (any location; set the `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable)
- Git

### 1. Clone the repository

```bat
git clone https://github.com/crowsyndrome/AltMan.git
cd AltMan
```

### 2. Bootstrap vcpkg (if you do not already have it)

```bat
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git %USERPROFILE%\vcpkg
%USERPROFILE%\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
```

### 3. Build

The easiest way to build is to run the provided batch script:

```bat
build.cmd
```

Or run these commands manually:

```bat
# Install dependencies
%USERPROFILE%\vcpkg\vcpkg.exe install --triplet x64-windows-static

# Configure
cmake -B build -S . ^
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=%USERPROFILE%\vcpkg\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake ^
  -A x64 ^
  -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-static ^
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# Build
cmake --build build --config Release --parallel
```

The executable will be generated at `build\altman\altman.exe` together with the required `assets` folder.

### 4. (Optional) Build from CLion

1. Open the project folder in CLion.
2. Go to **File ▸ Settings ▸ Build, Execution, Deployment ▸ CMake** and add\
   `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=%VCPKG_ROOT%/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake` to _CMake options_.
3. Make sure the **Toolchain** is set to the _Visual Studio_ toolchain (x86_64).
4. Press ▶️ to run the `altman` target.
